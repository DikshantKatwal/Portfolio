      where the majestic Himalayas inspire my innovative
                            approach to coding. With a solid foundation in
                            technologies like Python, React and databases.

                            Driven by a love for problem-solving and a
                            commitment to excellence, I enjoy turning complex
                            challenges into elegant, efficient code. When I'm
                            not coding, you might find me exploring the vibrant
                            culture of my homeland or trekking through stunning
                            landscapes. Let's connect and bring your next
                            project to life!
